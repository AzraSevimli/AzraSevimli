# 👋 Azra Sevimli

Computer Engineering student focused on **Embedded Systems**, **Microcontroller Programming**, and **Hardware–Software Communication**.

I build Arduino-based prototypes, integrate sensors, and develop real-time control systems tested on physical hardware.  
My goal is to strengthen system-level thinking and create structured, reliable embedded projects.
